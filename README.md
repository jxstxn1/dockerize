# dockerize_sidekick_plugin sidekick plugin

A plugin for [sidekick CLIs](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick).  

## Description

This plugin for [sidekick](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick) wants to make it as easy as possible to deploy your flutter web app as a docker container.

## Installation

### Kickstart

with having [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [sidekick](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick) installed

```bash
<<your_cli>> sidekick plugins install dockerize_sidekick_plugin
<<your_cli>> docker run -b
```

### Docker

To run this locally you need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.

### The commands

#### Install the plugin

```bash
<<your_cli>> sidekick plugins install dockerize_sidekick_plugin
```

#### Build the docker image

```bash
<<your_cli>> docker build
```

You can customize the build process in the commands/docker/build_command.dart file.

#### Run the docker image locally

```bash
<<your_cli>> docker run
```

This will run your app and makes it accessible at `localhost:8000`.
With the `--background` flag you can run the container in the background.
With the `-b, --build` flag you can execute the build command before running the container.
With the `-p, --port` flag you can specify the port on which the app is accessible.

You can detach from your running container with `Ctrl + P + Q` or `Ctrl + C`.
Afterwards you can kill the container with `<<your_cli>> docker stop`.

#### Stop the container

```bash
<<your_cli>> docker stop
```

### Help

If you need help, you can always use the help command.

```bash
<<your_cli>> docker --help
```
