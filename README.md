[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jxstxn1/dockerize_sidekick_plugin/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=PXZ5RFYXCL)](https://codecov.io/gh/jxstxn1/dockerize_sidekick_plugin)

A plugin for [sidekick CLIs](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick).  

## Description

This plugin for [sidekick](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick) wants to make it as easy as possible to deploy your flutter web app as a docker container.

## Installation

### Kickstart

with having [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [sidekick](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick) installed

```bash
<<your_cli>> sidekick plugins install dockerize_sidekick_plugin
<<your_cli>> docker run -b
```

### Docker

To run this locally you need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.

### The commands

#### Install the plugin

```bash
<<your_cli>> sidekick plugins install dockerize_sidekick_plugin
```

#### Build the Docker Image

There are multiple build commands available for this plugin. Here is a brief overview:

- `<<your_cli>> docker build app`: Runs a basic Flutter build web command
- `<<your_cli>> docker build scripts`: Runs all the required scripts to move files to the right place or hash scripts from the index.html
- `<<your_cli>> docker build image`: Builds the Docker image and also executes the app and scripts build commands
You can choose between different environments using the --env flag. The default environment is dev. You can customize the build process in the commands/build folder.

#### Run the Docker Image Locally

To run the Docker image locally, use the following command:

```bash
<<your_cli>> docker run
```

This will run the app and make it accessible at `localhost:8000`.

Notice:
A hot-reload is enabled, which will rerun the required build commands if you change a file. You can detach and kill the container by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

You can use the following flags to customize the run command:

- `-b, --build-all`: Executes all build commands before running the container (Recommended if you just changed something in the project)
- `-build-scripts`: Executes the scripts build command before running the container (Recommended if you just changed something in the server/ folder)
- `--build-image`: Executes the image build command before running the container (Recommended if you just changed something in the Dockerfile)
- `-p, --port`: Specifies the port on which the app is accessible.
The build command can choose between different environments. The default environment is `dev`. You can change the environment with the `--env` flag.

#### Stop the container

```bash
<<your_cli>> docker stop
```

#### Deploy the docker image

Deploying the docker image depends on the environment you are deploying to.
Here are the official guides for the biggest cloud providers:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-docker-containers/)
- [Azure](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/)
- [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/deploy-container)

### Further reading

#### Environments

By default we are generating a very simple way of handling different environments.
You can change the environments in the `commands/docker/environment.dart` file.

#### Script hashes

By default we are generating script hashes for each script tag in your index.html file.
You can change the hashtype or disable it in the `commands/docker/build_command.dart` file.

#### CSP Rules

By default we are adding a default Set of CSP rules to the `server/bin/middlewares.dart` File.
You can change the rules or disable them in the `commands/docker/build_command.dart` file.
You can find more informations about CSP Rules [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).
