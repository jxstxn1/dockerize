# dockerize_sidekick_plugin sidekick plugin

A plugin for [sidekick CLIs](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick).  

## Description

This plugin for [sidekick](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick) wants to make it as easy as possible to deploy your flutter web app as a docker container.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- install `sidekick`: `dart pub global activate sidekick`
- generate custom sidekick CLI: `sidekick init`

Installing plugins to a custom sidekick CLI is very similar to installing a package with
the [pub tool](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#activating-a-package).

### Installing dockerize as a sidekick plugin

```bash
<cli> sidekick plugins install dockerize_sidekick_plugin
```

### Building the Web App and the Container

```bash
<cli> docker build
```

You can customize the build process in the commands/docker/build_command.dart file.

### Run the Container

```bash
<cli> docker run
```

This will run your app and makes it accessible on port 8000. The full URL is <localhost:8000/#/>
With the -b, --build flag you can execute the build command before running the container.

### Stop the container

```bash
<cli> docker stop
```

### Help

If you need help, you can always use the help command.

```bash
<cli> docker --help
```
