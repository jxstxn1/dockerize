[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jxstxn1/dockerize_sidekick_plugin/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=PXZ5RFYXCL)](https://codecov.io/gh/jxstxn1/dockerize_sidekick_plugin)

A plugin for [sidekick CLIs](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick).  

## Description

This plugin for [sidekick](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick) wants to make it as easy as possible to deploy your flutter web app as a docker container.

## Installation

### Kickstart

with having [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [sidekick](https://pub.dev/packages/sidekick) installed

```bash
<<your_cli>> sidekick plugins install dockerize_sidekick_plugin
<<your_cli>> docker run -b
```

### Docker

To run this locally you need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.

### The commands

#### Install the plugin

```bash
<<your_cli>> sidekick plugins install dockerize_sidekick_plugin
```

#### Build the docker image

You have multiple build commands. Here is a short overview:

`<<your_cli>> docker build app` => basically a flutter build web command
`<<your_cli>> docker build scripts` => runs all required scripts to move the files to the right place or hash scripts from the index.html
`<<your_cli>> docker build image` => builds the docker image and also execute the app and scripts build commands

The build commands can choose between different environments.
The default environment is `dev`.
You can change the environment with the `--env` flag.

You can customize the build process in the `commands/build` folder.

#### Run the docker image locally

```bash
<<your_cli>> docker run
```

**Notice:**
**While you execute the run command, a hot-reload is enabled which will rerun the required build commands if you change a file.**
You can detach and kill the container by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

This will run your app and makes it accessible at `localhost:8000`.
With the `-b, --build-all` flag you can execute all build commands before running the container.(Recommended if you just changed something in the project)
With the `-build-scripts` flag you can execute the scripts build command before running the container.(Recommended if you just changed something in the `server/` folder)
With the `--build-image` flag you can execute the image build command before running the container.(Recommended if you just changed something in the `Dockerfile`)
With the `-p, --port` flag you can specify the port on which the app is accessible.

The build command can choose between different environments.
The default environment is `dev`.
You can change the environment with the `--env` flag.

#### Stop the container

```bash
<<your_cli>> docker stop
```

#### Deploy the docker image

Deploying the docker image depends on the environment you are deploying to.
Here are the official guides for the biggest cloud providers:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-docker-containers/)
- [Azure](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/)
- [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/deploy-container)

### Further reading

#### Environments

By default we are generating a very simple way of handling different environments.
You can change the environments in the `commands/docker/environment.dart` file.

#### Script hashes

By default we are generating script hashes for each script tag in your index.html file.
You can change the hashtype or disable it in the `commands/docker/build_command.dart` file.

#### CSP Rules

By default we are adding a default Set of CSP rules to the `server/bin/middlewares.dart` File.
You can change the rules or disable them in the `commands/docker/build_command.dart` file.
You can find more informations about CSP Rules [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

If you need help, you can always use the help command.
